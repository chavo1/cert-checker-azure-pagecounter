## Certificate Expiry Date Checker Script
#### Problem Statement:
Your task is to design and implement a script, which can be written in any scripting language of your choice (Python, Bash, PowerShell, etc.), to check and display the expiration date of the SSL/TLS certificate for the website [example.com](https://example.com/) The script should perform the following steps:

1. Make an HTTPS request to [example.com](https://example.com/)  to retrieve the SSL/TLS certificate information.
2. Parse the certificate data to extract the expiration date.
3. Display the expiration date in a human-readable format.

#### Script Requirements:

1. The script should be well-structured and maintainable, with appropriate comments and variable names for clarity.
2. Handle potential errors gracefully, such as network issues or invalid certificate data.
3. Ensure that the script provides a clear and readable output, making it easy to understand the certificate's expiration date.
4. Consider the efficiency of the script in terms of time and resource usage.
